    description: This project is a Magento 2-powered ice cream web store. It was migrated from Magento 1. My responsibilities in this project were to create a semi-custom solution based on the Magento data migration tool for migrating data from Magento 1. I developed REST API endpoints for the custom ice cream configurator, custom solutions for back-end-related client requirements, and successfully launched the project.
